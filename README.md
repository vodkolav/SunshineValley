Welcome to the wonderful world of commercial magical pony farming!
Life of a Magical Pony
In the far away land of Ponia, the magical
ponies roam happy and free, and are
eventually sold to toy companies for hefty
profit. A Pony lives its entire life on a
single farm, and is identifiable by a
unique numerical ID that is branded on
its hind leg. Ponies also have first and
last names, and ponies with the same
last name are considered family
members. A magical pony’s life
expectancy is about 25 years. In the first
years of their lives, their market value
grows; it peaks around the age of 5, and
then rapidly declines. There is little
economic sense in keeping ponies at the
farm after the age of 10. The pony
market is extremely volatile, so no exact prices are provided, only rough guidelines for
determining the worth of a magical pony.
Magical Powers
A magical pony develops its first magical power on its first birthday. Each birthday, a pony ​ has a
chance​ of acquiring an additional power, up to a maximum of four powers. The following
powers are available:
● The Power of Friendship​ : the pony’s enemies and frenemies have no effect, positive or
negative, on its popularity (see below)
● The Power of Love​ : the pony’s friends contributes twice as much to its popularity (see
below). This applies to true friends only, not to frenemies.
● The Power of Gratitude​ : treatments (see below) for this pony are provided without cost
● The Power of Kindness​ : No quantifiable effect
The more magical powers a pony has, the more it is worth. A pony that has acquired all four
magical powers is considered a ​ Powerful Pony ​ , and is worth considerably more than other
ponies. A pony that has acquired just one power and is past its fifth birthday is considered a
Puny Pony ​ , and is worth very little.Popularity
Magical ponies are highly social creatures. Each pony has feelings towards other ponies. The
feelings are unilateral, meaning Pony A can be a friend of Pony B without Pony B being a friend
of Pony A. A relationship is defined by ​ type​ and a number indicating ​ intensity​ . A feeling may be
one of the following:
● Friend​ : the intensity of the relationship contributes to the recipient’s popularity
● Enemy​ : the intensity of the relationship detracts to the recipient’s popularity
● Frenemy​ : if a pony has more friends than enemies, a frenemy is treated like a friend.
Otherwise, a frenemy is treated as an enemy.
A pony’s popularity rating is calculated by adding in the intensity of friendships and subtracting
the intensity of enmities. In addition, a pony receives ​ 1 ​ popularity point for each family member
currently living in the farm. A pony with a negative popularity rating is a ​ Pariah Pony ​ , and is
worth nothing; it also degrades the values of all other ponies on the farm. A pony with popularity
rating of ​ at least 150​ is a ​ Popular Pony ​ , and is worth considerably more than regular ponies.
For other ponies, popularity is strongly correlated with value.
Treatments
When ponies ​ get depressed​ or ​ lose their sparkle​ , they are taken to a physical or
psychological treatment. These cost a lot of money (to ponies without The Power of Gratitude),
and make up the main cost of magical pony farming.
The Task
Your company has recently purchased ​ Sunshine Valley ​ , a struggling mid-level magical pony
farm. As the company’s analyst, you are tasked with going over the farm’s data and issuing a
report. Specifically, you are expected to do the following:
● Take stock.​ The business needs to know how much the farm is worth. Be as accurate
as possible, but stick to the relevant details. Accurate financial details in the magical
pony business are in constant flux, so the actual costs and revenues from each aspect
or pony farming are not available to you; actual worth will be determined later by the
business people, based on the data you present.
● Find anomalies.​ The data in the business case describes ideal conditions at a pony
farm. ​ Sunshine Valley ​ is not an ideal farm. The data contains several anomalies: find
one or two of them and include them in your report. The anomalies are relatively
straightforward; there is no need for advanced statistical modelling to locate them.
● Provide actionable insights.​ Based on your findings, suggest actions the business
might take to improve the situation at Sunshine Valley.
● Provide directions for future analysis​ . We don’t expect you to delve too deeply into
the data during this test. We would, however, like to know what else you would have
checked given more time.
